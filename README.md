# Reinforcement-Learning-via-Curriculum-in-a-Wireless-Network-with-High-User-Mobility

## Overview
This is the Simulation code for Resource Allocation and User Association Using Reinforcement Learning Through Curriculum in a Wireless Network with High User Mobility

With the rapid development of wireless networks and artificial intelligence technologies, various applications of mobile networks have emerged. In particular, resource allocation becomes more complicated and handover problems occur more often when the user's mobility is high, such as the vehicle Internet. In addition, the problem of resource allocation in wireless networks is known as the NP-Hard problem. Using reinforcement learning to solve this problem is a promising solution. However, designing a reward function is very difficult, and incorrect design of the reward function can lead to completely unexpected results. In this paper, we propose a curriculum learning technique to solve the above problems so that reinforcement learning agents can learn more accurately. During learning, each user's mobility was sequentially increased so that the model could learn accurately.
